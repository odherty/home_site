<h1>Patrick O'Doherty</h1>
<p>Hello! This is some examples of work I've done that I'm proud of. It's pretty simple stuff, but <br>
it will give you a feel for what kind of stuff I've done at my job.</p>
<p>I've had several projects at the <a href="https://www.kentuckymathematics.org/index2.php">KCM</a>, a lot of which is updating and tweaking old, unorganized code. I cannot <br>
link all of it as some of it deals with student data.</p>
<p>I've had more work in back-end development than front-end, but am very intrested in doing more front-end development <br>
to improve my skill as a web developer</p>

<p>NOTE: For the Help Sample listed above, the page is supposed to allow the user to update the FAQ using the buttons. <br>
The university site I'm hosting this on doesn't allow permissons for the file functions that normally would work, so this functionality is down. <br>
You can see how it is supposed to work in the code.</p>
<p>Below, I have a link to screenshots of things I'm proud of, but cannot link as the content is sensitive<br></p>
